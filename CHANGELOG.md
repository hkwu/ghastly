## [Unreleased]
## [0.4.0]
### Changed
- Custom `Response` classes no longer receive the command handler's `context` automatically in their executor functions.
- `VoiceResponse` now takes the handler's context as its first argument in addition to its existing arguments.

## [0.3.0]
### Added
- `@me` prefix for selfbots.
- Additional filter middleware.
- Command groups.
- Service dependency declaration within command configurations.

### Changed
- `ServiceRegistry#fetch()` is now `ServiceRegistry#get()`.
- `ServiceRegistry#bind()` has been split up into `#bind()`, `#singleton()` and `#instance()`.
- `dispatchError` event has been changed to `dispatchFail`. This event now emits two arguments: the type of failure encountered and an object with the failure context.
- `@self` prefix is now `@client`.
- Command registration moved to client's command registry's `add()` method. Client dispatcher is now a private property.
