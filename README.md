# Ghastly

A framework designed to make it easier to modularize clients built on top of [Discord.js](http://hydrabolt.github.io/discord.js/).

## Quick Start

Work in progress.

## Developing

This framework uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile the source code into the final distributed library. Simply make changes to the source in `src/` then type

```bash
npm run build
```

to transpile the entire `src/` directory into the `lib/` directory. You can also use

```
npm run watch
```

to continuously watch the `src/` directory for changes and transpile on the go.
